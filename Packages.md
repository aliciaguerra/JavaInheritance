Packages are used in Java in order to prevent naming conflicts, to control access, to make searching/locating
and uses of classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotations easier, etc.

A package can be defined as a group of related types (classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotations) providing
access protection and name space management.

Some of the existing packages in Java are:
 - java.lang - bundles the fundamental classes
 - java.io - classes for input, output functions are bundled in this package
 
Programmers can define their own packages to bundle group of classes/interfaces, etc. It is a good practice to
group related classes implemented by you so that a programmer can easily determine that the classes, interfaces,
enumerations, annotations are related.

Since the package creates a new namespace there won't be any name conflicts
